In this study I build a step by step web scraper using Python.

For this study, I scraped data from IMDb’s “Top 1000” movies. The information I gather from each movie are:

The title
The year it was released
How long the movie is
IMDb’s rating of the movie
The Metascore of the movie
How many votes the movie got
The U.S. gross earnings of the movie

The file movies.csv is the final output of the program
